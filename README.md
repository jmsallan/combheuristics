# combheuristics

This package wraps some algorithms to solve combinatorial problems. The algorithms can be constructive heuristics, or based on metaheuristics like simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, GRAPS and iterated local search.

The package contains also data for testing the heuristics picked from several sources, parsed and ready to use into R.

The code is written in R, so it is slow code intended for teaching purposes. I try to stick to base R as much as possible.
